In our current day, approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being generated by customers around the globe every single day. A customer generates data at almost every point in the day. A customer generates data even as they sleep through the night to track their sleeping patterns!

With the generation of copious amount of data by customers, businesses have started to leverage it to make data-driven decisions for their organization. Businesses have shifted focus from being product driven to customer centric. In the past, the growth of a brand was mainly dependent on advertisements. But with the advancement of technology to collect and process this huge amount of data, it has become key to understand your customer to market ones products, understand what customers think of the product, understand user behaviour or enhance customer experience. This process of collecting and analyzing the customer data to understand customers is called customer analytics.

Machine learning is one of the key tools used in customer analytics and in this article we will see 5 applications:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Customer segmentation</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
  <li>Customer churn prediction</li>
  <li>Recommendation system</li>
  <li>Customer service</li>
</ol>

<h2> Customer segmentation </h2>
<p>
Every customer is unique in their characteristic and behaviour. But there is also presence of certain similarities that can be identified in the vast data. There are various factors such as demographics, geographic, behavioural, need-based and value-based to name a few that would help us segment the customers. These segments help understand specific customer behaviour patterns which in turn help us in what different customer segments are looking for, run targeted campaigns and also improve customer engagement.

But how do we segment the customers when we have millions of rows of data? We use machine learning strategies! Clustering algorithms such as K-Means help identify similar groups within the data. We can then understand the different groups to send targeted advertisements, promotions or recommendations.

</p>
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>

<p>
After months of planning, designing and creating you’ve officially rolled out your product. But how do you know what your customers are talking about your product? One way to understand this is through customer sentiment analysis. By collecting customer reviews on marketplaces, websites, customer service calls or customer feedback surveys, we end up with a large amount of text data. We can use natural language processing to identify what aspects of the product a customer is talking about and if the views are positive, neutral or negative.

The voice of the customer is very important as understanding your customer this way helps tweak the product or service, understand what makes *your* customer happy or enhance brand perception among the competitors.

</p>
<h2>Customer churn prediction</h2>

<p>
Acquiring a new customer is 5 times more expensive than retaining an existing customer. Hence, the main goal of customer churn prediction is to help retain customers which in turn helps increase revenue of the company. The churn data of a customer is collected through either the inactivity of the customer over a certain period of time or cancellation of the product or service.

Hence we can use binary classification methods such as logistic regression to predict if a customer would potentially churn or not. If it seems like a customer has potential to churn, we can furthur investigate the customer to see what segment they belong to and take steps accordingly to retain the customer.

</p>
<h2>Recommendation system</h2>

<p>
When we go to a store and are assisted by a shopkeeper, we not only get what we are looking for but the shopkeeper tries to cross sell or upsell their products. This is similar to what a recommendation system does when a customer makes purchases online. The benefits of recommendation engines aim to improve personalization, revenue and customer satisfaction. This not only helps the customer discover new products but also helps the company improve its revenue.

Some methods of implementing such a system is through the creation of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and hybrid recommendation systems using customer purchasing and behaviour data and identify similarities with other customer purchases.

</p>
<h2>Customer service</h2>

<p>
A customer’s time is extremely valuable. Throughout a customer’s journey with an organization, product or service, there will be multiple points where a customer is in need of support. We can collect the type of service calls, interactions with chatbots, the number of times a customer has visited the support page or the visits made to the store for offline support. This will help in analyzing the where a customer needs the most support.

We can use regression methods to identify patterns in these factors to predict when an issue might occur or how to reduce the number of complaints of a customer. This would enhance customer experience and also reduce churn of the customer.

<p>
The 5 applications mentioned above is only an overview of few ways of applying machine learning to customer data. There are plenty of applications and alternatives to machine learning for each of the applications mentioned above but these are some of the common applications being used by businesses in various domains to make data driven customer centric decisions to enhance customer experience and improve revenue.
