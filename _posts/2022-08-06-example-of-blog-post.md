<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A media investment for today, does not limit its effect to the current timeperiod. Adstocking for the media investments in a media mix modeling exercise makes it more accurate. Media channels do not have a linear relationship to your KPI. Hence. adstocking helps take care of this.</p>
<p>The Adstock effect or the Carryover effect, carry forwards a percentage of the effect or exposure to a future timeperiod. The idea is that, an advertisement seen today, will be remembered and acted upon at a later point in time, increasing your sales value or awareness levels.</p>


<h2>Simple Adstock Effect</h2>
<p>The total adstock is the media invest at week 1 followed by summing up the week 2 investment with the adstocked media at week 1 and so on.</p>

<p>The below graph demonstrates an adstocked curve for two adstock rates: 50% and 60%. Higher the adstock rate, longer the media investment is carried on.</p>

<p>The adstock in other words is also called as the simple decay effect. The simple decay percentage is:</p>
